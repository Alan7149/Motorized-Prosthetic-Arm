# Designing, Building and Controlling a Motorized Prosthetic Arm

Author: Yael Ben Shalom<br>
Final project, MS in Robotics at Northwestern, 2021.


## Mechanical Design of the Prosthetic Elbow

The system contained several key parts:

1. Motor (T-Motor, R60 KV115)
2. Encoder PCB (Designed for a Magnetic Rotary Encoder (AS5048A))
3. Driver (ODrive V3.6, 24V)
4. Odrive Adaptor PCB (Adaptor from ODrive connector to ethernet connector)
5. Elbow packaging (based on [Fillauer E-400](https://www.spsco.com/hosmer-e-400.html))
6. Battery
