# Designing, Building and Controlling a Motorized Prosthetic Arm

Final project, MS in Robotics at Northwestern, 2021.


## Data Collection

In this part of the project, I focused on measuring prosthetics characteristics and collecting body-arm motion data.

To explore the body-arm motion while walking, and to find the correlation between walking speed and arm swing, I attached accelerometers to my lower back, upper arm, and forearm, and measured the angles, velocities, and accelerations. An example of the results are presented in the following video:
